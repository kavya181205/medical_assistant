# 🩺 Medical RAG Assistant (WHO & CDC)

A **safe, intelligent medical information system** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** over **WHO and CDC guidelines**, with **routing, symptom triage, and emergency escalation**.

This project demonstrates **responsible use of LLMs** in a **high-risk medical domain**, focusing on **accuracy, safety, and explainability** rather than raw generation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📄 **WHO & CDC guideline–based knowledge base**
- 🔀 **Rule-based query routing** (policy, clinical, symptom, emergency)
- 🌡️ **Symptom sub-routing**  
  - Fever → Dengue / Malaria / General Fever  
- 🚨 **Emergency detection & hard bypass** (no RAG, no LLM hallucination)
- 🧠 **LangChain Runnable-based RAG pipeline** (LangChain 1.x compatible)
- 🧪 **Evaluation test cases** for routing & safety validation
- 🖥️ **Interactive Streamlit web app** (dark theme, demo-ready)

## 📂 Knowledge Sources

The system uses **authoritative medical documents**, including:

- WHO Dengue Guidelines  
- WHO Diarrhoea Guidelines  
- WHO Malaria Guidelines  
- WHO HIV Guidelines  
- WHO Fever Guidance  
- WHO Mental Health Policy  
- CDC Common Cold Guidance  
- Asthma Clinical Guidelines  

Each document is tagged with metadata (`disease`, `knowledge_type`) to enable **precise routing and retrieval**.

## 🧩 Technology Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangChain (Runnables API)**
- **FAISS** (Vector Store)
- **HuggingFace / OpenAI LLMs**
- **Streamlit** (UI)
- **Pathlib** (OS-independent paths)

## ⚠️ Medical Safety Design

This project follows **medical AI best practices**:

- ❌ No diagnosis  
- ❌ No medicine prescription or dosage  
- ❌ No hallucinated answers  
- ✅ Explicit refusal when information is missing  
- ✅ Emergency escalation without LLM usage  

> If sufficient information is not found in WHO/CDC documents, the system replies:  
> **“I could not find this information in WHO/CDC guidelines.”**

## 🖥️ Streamlit Application

The project includes a **live interactive UI** built with Streamlit.

### Features:
- User-friendly medical question input
- Visible routing decisions
- Emergency warnings highlighted
- Dark theme for professional appearance

### Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
